# Investigation conclusion
- Nx is a nice tool in general but it needs lot of configuration
- If we want to continue this way we need to learn and investigate a bit more about Nx confituration
- From here we can continue making the libs work in the backend as well. For example backend should use @user-office-software-libs/validation instead of npm package. This will require maybe bootstraping new express server app and see how it is configurated to be able to use the local libs
- Also the frontend needs some modification of the webpack configuration to use all libs from source not only few of them like it is at the moment. We use package called `craco` to overwrite create-react-app webpack configuration on the go. This also needs some more investigation how it should be done because now `shared-types` lib uses build version instead of source one which shouldn't be the case.
- Here are some examples of nx workspaces that are using libs and are configured well (they might be a bit old and nx configs might have changed a bit since then): https://blog.nrwl.io/using-apollo-graphql-with-react-in-an-nx-workspace-99db8d69cebe, https://vitaterna.ca/using-apollo-prisma-and-nexus-with-react-in-an-nx-workspace

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/web`
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/angular`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@temp-workspace/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
